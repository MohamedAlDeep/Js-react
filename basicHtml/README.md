# Basic html project 
For educational purpose. 

No license required to this app since there is no way to get benefit from it.

The project is made as playground for javascript (DOM-js) the **css** and **html** are simple.

## HTML
The basic form of standard html file only the title had been changed to "JavaScript App". Then the css file is linked and at the bottom the *java***script** is linked.
### Components 
The file contains main *div* with class of "container" that wraps all html under the body tag. Then there is the "h1" tag that is supposed to work as the product of the calculator's operation (Subject to change). Then the *input* tags they are inside there own *div* with class of "root" (made on purpose to be precise).
### Notes 
The name attribute in *input* tag is not important in this case (Subject to change).
## CSS
Basic css no fancy stuff. I did a little reset for the body. And used the grid for displaying the buttons. Then made a little hover animation for the buttons. 
Then changed the background color to match with the buttons color.
